## Course Description

This is a course on computational financial modeling for financial technology (FinTech). We will cover the microfoundations of financial innovation and entrepreneurship which go back to Adam Smith and the classical economists. The main emphasis of the course is on computational finance and financial computing. Students will learn computational modeling with applications in finance from corporate finance, investments, and risk management. Foundational concepts from computer science and software engineering will be introduced in a just-in-time manner. Upon completion of the course students will have a new analytical framework for thinking about financial problem solving as well as a deep practical skill set in computational modeling. Arbitrage is the core theme of the course. We will view the core subject from the perspectives of history, philosophy, technology, and economic theory.
