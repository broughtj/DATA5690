# Introduction {.unnumbered}

These notes on ___probability___ are based on Chapter 2 of @MartinezMartinez2016.

We start with the concept of an ___experiment___, which is defined as a _process or action whose outcome cannot be predicted with certainty and would likely change when the experiment is repeated_.

* This is the process by which the data are generated in the real-world.
* __NB:__ It does not necessarily imply that the agent has complete or even partial experimental control.

Next we define the ___sample space___ denoted by $S$.
